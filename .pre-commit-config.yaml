# Notes:
# 1. `uv-lock` hook re-resolves and regenerates the lockfile to match pyproject.toml
# 2. `ruff-format` runs before `ruff-check` (format then lint)
# 3. `--exit-non-zero-on-fix` flag blocks commits when ruff makes automatic fixes, must review first
# 4. `pyright` runs type checking to catch type errors before commits
# 5. `pass_filenames: false` on pytest runs the full test suite rather than only testing modified files
# 6. pytest also triggers on pyproject.toml/uv.lock changes to catch dependency breakage
